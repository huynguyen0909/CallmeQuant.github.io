I am really delighted if you can find the readings useful for your purposes. My name is Binh and I am currently an autodidactic in Advanced Statistics. As a graduate student majoring in Applied Mathematics, I
aspire to expand my research and interest in econometrics, machine learning, and forecasting. With an earnest willingness to be a part of the financial and forecasting field, I bring my
best to even the utmost trivial jobs.

My favorite would be the one from Richard Feynman. These words also play a critical role in constituting my self-learning path and the way I approach old and new knowledge. Last but not least
I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing!
