I came across this problem by chance when practicing for my Master's entrance exam. In this post, I will derive the *maximum likelihood estimators* (MLE) for the Weibull distribution with two parameters. For maximum likelihood estimation, I will have a different to discuss some basic concepts of this parametric estimation technique that is used extensively in many subfields of statistics. 

# **Introduction**
Before deriving the MLE for Weibull distribution, it is unusual not to introduce some characterisitics of this distribution. Weibull distribution is a *continuous* probability distribution characterized by two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ respectively. These parameters are also called the shape and the scale parameters that is skewed (left- or right- skewed data can be captured via the **shape** parameter.

To be continued!
